If you want to change your account's credit card details, go to the left side panel, click **Account settings**  &#8594; **Billing**  &#8594; scroll to **Payment information**. Enter the new credit card details on the respective fields then click on **Update payment information**. Only the _account owner_ can make this change. 

To change your billing name or location address, send our Support team a message at support@getdbt.com with the newly updated information, and we can make that change for you!
