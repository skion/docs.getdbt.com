`dbt deps` pulls the most recent version of the dependencies listed in your `packages.yml` from git. See [Package-Management](/docs/build/packages) for more information.

Where relevant, dbt will display up to date and/or latest versions of packages that are listed on dbt Hub. Example below.

> This does NOT apply to packages that are installed via git/local

```yaml

  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils

  - package: dbt-labs/codegen
    version: 0.4.0
  - package: calogica/dbt_expectations
    version: 0.4.1
  - git: https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-audit-helper.git

## Predictable package installs

Starting in dbt v1.7, dbt generates a `package-lock.yml` file in the root of your project. This file ensures consistent and predictable package installs by storing the exact versions (including commit SHAs) of all resolved packages specified in your `packages.yml` or `dependencies.yml`. This consistency is crucial for maintaining stability in development and production environments, preventing unexpected issues from new releases with potential bugs.

When you run `dbt deps`, dbt installs packages based on the locked versions in `package-lock.yml`. To update these locked versions, you must explicitly run `dbt deps --upgrade` and commit the updated `package-lock.yml` file. Storing this file in version control guarantees consistency across all environments and for all developers.

### Managing `package-lock.yml`

The `package-lock.yml` file should be committed to Git initially and updated only when you intend to change versions or uninstall a package. For example, run `dbt deps --upgrade` to get updated package versions or `dbt deps --lock` to update the lock file based on changes to the packages config without installing the packages.

To bypass using `package-lock.yml` entirely, you can add it to your project's `.gitignore`. However, this approach sacrifices the predictability of builds. If you choose this route, we strongly recommend adding version pins for third-party packages in your `packages` config.

### Detecting changes in `packages` config

The `package-lock.yml` file includes a `sha1_hash` of your packages config. If you update `packages.yml`, dbt will detect the change and rerun dependency resolution during the next `dbt deps` command. To update the lock file without installing the new packages, use the `--lock` flag:

```shell
dbt deps --lock
```

### Forcing package updates

To update all packages, even if `packages.yml` hasnâ€™t changed, use the `--upgrade` flag:

```shell

dbt deps --upgrade

```

This is particularly useful for fetching the latest commits from the `main` branch of an internally maintained Git package. 

:::warning
Forcing package upgrades may introduce build inconsistencies unless carefully managed.
:::

### Adding specific packages

The `dbt deps` command can add or update package configurations directly, saving you from remembering exact syntax. 

#### Hub packages (default)

Hub packages are the default package types and the easiest to install.

```shell
dbt deps --add-package dbt-labs/dbt_utils@1.0.0

# with semantic version range
dbt deps --add-package dbt-labs/snowplow@">=0.7.0,<0.8.0"
```

#### Non-Hub packages

Use the `--source` flag to specify the type of package to be installed:

```shell

# Git package
dbt deps --add-package https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amplitude@v0.3.0 --source git

# Local package
dbt deps --add-package /opt/dbt/redshift --source local
```
