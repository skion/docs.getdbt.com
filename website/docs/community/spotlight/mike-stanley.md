  I've split my time between financial services and the video games industry. Back when I wrote code every day, I worked in marketing analytics and marketing technology. I've been in the dbt community for about two years. I haven't authored any extensions to dbt's adapters yet but I've given feedback on proposed changes!

## When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?

I've led data teams for almost ten years now and it can be a challenge to stay current on new technology when you're spending a lot of time on leadership and management. I joined the dbt Community to learn how to get more from it, how to solve problems and use more advanced features, and to learn best practices. I find that answering questions is the way I learn best, so I started helping people!

## Which dbt Community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?

I hope that we can all continue to level up our dbt skills and leave the data environments that we work in better than we found them.

## What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?

Everything! People share so much about their best practices and when and how to deviate from them, interesting extensions to dbt that they've worked on, common bugs and problems, and how to think in a "dbtish" way. I couldn't have learned any of that without the community!
