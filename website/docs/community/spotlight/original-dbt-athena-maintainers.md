title: The Original dbt-athena Maintainers
description: |
  The original dbt-athena Maintainers is a group of 5 people—Jérémy Guiselin, Mattia, Jesse Dobbelaere, Serhii Dimchenko, and Nicola Corda—who met via dbt Slack in the #db-athena channel, with the aim to make make <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/athena-setup">dbt-athena</a> a production-ready adapter.

  In the first periods, Winter 2022 and Spring 2023, we focused on contributing directly to the adapter, adding relevant features like Iceberg and Lake Formation support, and stabilizing some internal behaviour.
 
  On a second iteration our role was triaging, providing community support and bug fixing. We encouraged community members to make their first contributions, and helped them to merge their PRs.

## When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?

The dbt community allowed the dbt-athena maintainers to meet each other, and share the common goal of making the dbt-athena adapter production-ready.

## Which dbt Community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?

As we grow, we are looking to embody democratic leadership.

## What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?

We learned that the power of the community was endless. People started to share best practises, and some of the best practises were incorporated directly in dbt-athena, allowing people to run the adapter smoothly in their production environment.
We reached a point where people started to ask advice for their AWS architecture, which we found pretty awesome.
